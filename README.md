# CSC120-FinalProject
This assignment was tough because I have never made a video game in code before. I felt like there were many ways in which my video game could have been better. For example, when giving the user an ability to make a choice, if they made a choice that was unapplicable, I could not figure out how to return to the beginning of the if-loop and allow the player to make a different choice. Additionally, I could not figure out how to allow the code to be more player-driven. Also, I know that I could have made the code using multiple classes. However, the process I used of only having one class made the most sense to me and that's why I selected it. Something I learned during this process is how helpful it is to diagram out all of the possible options for my game. I used a whiteboard to write out every path and the choices possible so that I had a better understanding of the different possibilities and so I didn't get lost when writing the code. I also learned the importance of having my friends who don't code try my game and talk through it with me.Attached is a photo of a blueprint of the house.
