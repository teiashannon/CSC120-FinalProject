This file will contain documentation for all commands available in your game.

Note:  It's a good idea to also make this list available inside the game, in response to a `HELP` command.

Possible commands include:
PICK UP to pick up an item
OPEN to open a door
FIGHT to fight an opponent
RUN to run away from an opponent
JUMP to jump
USE to use an object in your inventory

# SPOILER ALERT

If your game includes challenges that must be overcome to win, also list them below.

If you don't pick up the key on the table in the foyer, there's no way to win.
